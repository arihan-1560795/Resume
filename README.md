## Projects

- **Python Data Modelling (ML)** ([GitHub](https://github.com/arihan-1560795/Resume/tree/master/Sample%20Code/WI19-371))
    - Clean, analyze, model, visualize text reviews, housing, breast cancer, and public assisntace datasets. 
    - Use preset, implement own ML models and evaluate using metrics like accuracy, ROC curves, decision boundary plots. <br/> <br/>

- **Hospital Recommender** ([App](https://arihan.shinyapps.io/hospital-search/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/Info-370-Winter-2018/group-formation-for-projects-platypus)) <br/>
Technology used: (_RStudio, Shiny, Google Maps API_)
    - App produces output on user defined location, distance, and reason for visit. 
    - Ranks hospitals on their treatment effectivness and plots them on a map. 
    - Queries Google Mapâ€™s API for geo-data, narrows zip-code using RedLine13's API. <br/>
