## Projects

- **Python Data Modelling (ML)** (_Python_) 

[Link to GitHub](https://github.com/arihan-1560795/Resume/tree/master/Sample%20Code/WI19-371)
Clean, analyze, model, visualize breast cancer, review, housing, email, and government assistance datasets. Implement, use preset, and evaluate machine learning models using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrixes, ROC curves, decision boundary plots, and more. 

- **IoT Security Evaluation** (_Python_)

Clean, analyze, model, visualize breast cancer, review, housing, email, and government assistance datasets. Implement, use preset, and evaluate machine learning models using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrixes, ROC curves, decision boundary plots, and more. 

 - **Hospital Recommender** (_RStudio, Shiny, Google Maps API_) 
[Link to App](https://arihan.shinyapps.io/hospital-search/) | [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/Info-370-Winter-2018/group-formation-for-projects-platypus)
App takes user user location, reason for visit. Filters dataset to shows, plots hospitals on a map ranked in their ability to treat the given problem. It was developed using RStudio and made use of the the Google Maps and the RedLine13 APIs towards [Medicare](https://data.medicare.gov/) data.

- **AirBNB Property Finder** (_Tableau, pSQL, AWS RDS_)

Project lead on pSQL database development on Amazon's Relational Database Service. The tool provides insights into AirBNB data and helps people filter through it to find properties. The DB back end was built to be as efficient as possible; and the dashboard shows how various features are related.

- **Transportation Data Pipeline** (_SQL, Excel, Shiny_)
[Link to Screenshots](https://github.com/arihan-1560795/CEE412-Transportation-Data-Management-Project/tree/master/Screenshots) | [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/arihan-1560795/CEE412-Transportation-Data-Management-Project)
Data Pipeline for managing, storing, analyzing, and visualizing transportation data for bicycles. Involved importing data into created SQL tables and querying, visualizing them through RStudio.

- **Bitcoin Infographic** (_Adobe Illustrator, Tableau, Excel_)
[Link to Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arihan-1560795/Bitcoin-Infographic/master/Final-render.png) | [Link to raw files](https://github.com/arihan-1560795/Bitcoin-Infographic)
Infographic about Bitcoin's lifecycle, facts, spatial distribution, and temporal variation. Various displays modelled in Excel, Tableau, or within Adobe Illustrator itself.
